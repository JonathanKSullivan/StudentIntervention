    "**Answer: **\n",
    "# 1. Decision Trees\n",
    "### Real-world Applications\n",
    "    * Used for building personal learning assistants and for classifying sleep signals\n",
    "    * Used for remote sensing for pattern recognition\n",
    "    * Used for the detection of physical particles\n",
    "    * Used for analyzing amino acid sequences\n",
    "    *  automatic induction of decision trees can be found in diagnosis, cardiology, psychiatry, gastroenterology, for detecting microcalcifications in mammography, to analyze Sudden Infant Death (SID) syndrome and for diagnosing thyroid disorders.\n",
    "    * Automatic induction of decision trees was recently used for control of nonlinear dynamical systems\n",
    "    * Helped in star-galaxy classification [372], determining galaxy counts [371] and discovering quasars [177] in the Second Palomar Sky Survey\n",
    "    * Used for filtering noise from Hubble Space Telescope images\n",
    "    * Used to non-destructively test welding quality, for semiconductor manufacturing, for increasing productivity, for material procurement method selection, to accelerate rotogravure printing, for process optimization in electrochemical machining, to schedule printed circuit board assembly lines, to uncover flaws in a Boeing manufacturing process and for quality control. \n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "    * Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualised.\n",
    "    * Requires little data preparation. \n",
    "    * The cost of using the tree is O(log(n)).\n",
    "    * Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. \n",
    "    * Able to handle multi-output problems.\n",
    "    * Uses a white box model.\n",
    "    * Possible to validate a model using statistical tests.\n",
    "    * Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true model from which the data were generated.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Disadvatages\n",
    "    * Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well. \n",
    "    *Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. \n",
    "    * The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts.\n",
    "    * There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems.\n",
    "    * Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. \n",
    "### Why this is useful for us?\n",
    "    * Some of this data might affect the data more so than not. It would be possible to get huge changes in Entropy, with a shallow tree. For Instance, we can expect Absenes to give us alot more information than age or sex. Also our data contains both numerical and categorical features which Decision Trees are good at handling. \n",
    "# 2. Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "### Real-world Applications\n",
    "    * Used to classify proteins with up to 90% of the compounds classified correctly. \n",
    "    * Used to recognize Hand-written characters.\n",
    "    * Used for Classification of images.\n",
    "    * Used in text and hypertext categorization as their application can significantly reduce the need for labeled training instances.\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "    * Effective in high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "    * Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "    * Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\n",
    "    * Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. \n",
    "### Disadvatages\n",
    "    * If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, the method is likely to give poor performances.\n",
    "    * SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "### Why this is useful for us?\n",
    "    * Support Vector machines offers high versitility and handles high number of features. Our data high a high number of features which could be hard to fit with a 47-dimensional plane. The Advantage of the Kernel provides us is that we can linearly transformation that can make our data linearly seperable.\n",
    "# 3. K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "### Real-world Applications\n",
    "    * Used in protein- protein interaction prediction.\n",
    "    * Used in predicting gene expression.\n",
    "    * Used in Computer Vision based Content Retrieval.(ie. Video)\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "    * Robust to noisy training data.\n",
    "    * Effective if the training data is large.\n",
    "### Disadvatages\n",
    "    * Need to determine value of parameter K (number of nearest neighbors).\n",
    "    * Distance based learning is not clear which type of distance to use and which attribute to use to produce the best results. \n",
    "    * Computation cost is quite high because we need to compute distance of each query instance to all training samples. Some indexing (e.g. K-D tree) may reduce this computational cost.\n",
    "### Why this is useful for us?\n",
    "    * K-Nearest neighbor is my prime choice. Even though we dont have a lot of data I believe that we will find regions of similarly classified data in this 48-dimensional space."

    "**Answer: ** Using the SVM Classifier will be to expensive. It will either take a long time to teach our computers  about the students or very expensive hardware to do it fast. However if we were to use the KNN and DT Classifiers we could tacke the problem cheaply. Out of those 2 options KNN seem to be right more often even before we try to \"help\" the machines out. Even If we dont have all the factor that contribute to student failiure, our result will capture effectively relationships that do exist in our data. Even as we start to add more and more students to our databases our model should still hold. So imagine you gave me an address and ask me information about the occupants, but didnt allow me to talk to the occupants only their neighbors. Also I can not ask the neighbors directly about the occupant because either they dont know the information or wont tell me. Well If 30/40 of their neighbors are millenial parents, 35/40 of their neighbor are african american and 38/40 of the neighbor are Democrats, then I could guess with some certainty that the occupant of that address are young black parents who affliliate with the Democratic Party.  In the same way that real life neighborhoods share common data. Our algorithm make a neighborhood around the things we want to know. This is because what the KNN is doing under the hood is grabing a certain number of datapoint, K amount, that are the most similar in some way(ie. in the closet neighbors in their neighborhood). It looking at the information these neighboring data gives us and makes a guess about the datapoint we want to know about(the occupant). This is useful to us because we can enter information about a student. That information get an address in the data world. Then we will be able to see if his neighbors in this data world needed intervention or not. If his data-neighbors did then so does this student, and likewise in the converse case."
