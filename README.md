# StudentIntervention
Constructed an intervention system that leverages supervised learning techniques. Developed a model that will predict the likelihood that a given student will pass, quantifying whether an intervention is necessary.
## Purpose:
In this project a fictitious local school district has a goal to reach a 95% graduation rate by the end of the decade by identifying students who need intervention before they drop out of school. I modeled the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam, by constructing an intervention system that leverages supervised learning techniques. The board of supervisors has asked that I find the most effective model that uses the least amount of computation costs to save on the budget. I analyzed the dataset on students' performance and develop a model that will predict the likelihood that a given student will pass, quantifying whether an intervention is necessary.
